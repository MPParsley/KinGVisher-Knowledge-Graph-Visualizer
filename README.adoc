= KinGVisher - Knowledge Graph Visualizer

The KinGVisher - Knowledge Graph Visualizer - is a tool to visualize knowledge graphs in a web browser.
It uses existing RDF triplestore endpoints (e.g., https://www.dbpedia.org/[DBpedia], https://www.wikidata.org/[Wikidata], or your private endpoint) to retrieve the data and visualize it.
It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and creating visualizations by defining resources that are used as starting points for graph exploration, white and black lists for predicates, and visual styles for the nodes and edges.
For the implementation, we use the https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit] framework and https://github.com/ChrisDelClea/streamlit-agraph[agraph library] (a wrapper for the https://visjs.org/[vis.js] library).

== Online Demo

You can try out the tool online at https://wse-research.org/kingvisher-knowledge-graph-visualizer/ (or short https://wse-research.org/kingvisher).

== Start the application locally

First, install the requirements:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the application:

```shell
python3 -m streamlit run kingvisher-knowledge_graph_visualizer.py
```

== Start the application with Docker

A Docker image is available on https://hub.docker.com/r/wseresearch/knowledge-graph-visualizer[Dockerhub] for convenient usage.

```shell
docker run -p 8501:8501 wseresearch/knowledge-graph-visualizer:latest
```

If you want to build the image yourself, you can use the following command:

```shell
docker build -t knowledge-graph-visualizer:latest .
```

== Configuration

The configuration of the data sources and the visualization is done interactively via the web interface.
Please see the file link:./.env[.env] for the basic configuration of the application itself.
